    'How to make Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension work with Magento PWA Studio',
  description:
    'Magento PWA Studio used CSS modules and Tailwind CSS. The Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension does not work with CSS modules. Here is how I made it work.',

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

## Problem

[Magento PWA Studio](https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio) used CSS modules and Tailwind CSS.
The content of `*.module.css` files are like below snippet, [Read more here](https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio/discussions/3241).

```CSS
.pageWrapper {
    composes: pt-16 from global;
    composes: max-w-menu from global;
    composes: mx-auto from global;
    composes: px-20 from global;
}
```

The Tailwind CSS IntelliSense [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
does not work with this by default, because it is looking for `class="` or `className="`, etc. in a file.

## Solution

Currently there is an experimental option for the IntelliSense extension named `classRegex` whic is mentioned [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/7553#issuecomment-735915659).
Using this option, we can make the extension work with CSS modules.

```JSON
{
    "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
        ["composes: ([^;]*)"]
    ]
}
```

Add the above snippet to your vscode settings and your are good to go. If you want it to work only with your pwa-studio project, you can add it to `.vscode/settings.json` file in your repository.
