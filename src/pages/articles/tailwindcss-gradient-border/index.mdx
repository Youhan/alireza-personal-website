## Give me the code

```html
    <div class="relative rounded-2xl p-8">
        <div class="absolute -inset-px bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-pink-400 rounded-2xl" aria-hidden="true"></div>
        <div class="absolute inset-0 bg-zinc-900 rounded-2xl" aria-hidden="true"></div>
        <div class="z-10 text-zinc-100">Nice border around me!</div>
    </div>
```

<Image src={image1} alt="TailwindCSS gradient border" />

## Explain

First we have a `div` that has a `p-8` for it's content.

What is behind it is a div that is position absolute and has `-inset-px`, meaning it is the same size as the parent div but 1px outside of it. This is the gradient border. It has a `bg-gradient-to-r` class that makes it a gradient from left to right. The `from-yellow-400` and `to-pink-400` classes are the colors of the gradient.

Then there is the second `div` that is also position absolute and has `inset-0` class. This is the background color.

Enjoy ✌🏻
