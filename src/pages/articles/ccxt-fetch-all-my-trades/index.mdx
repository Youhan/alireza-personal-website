Binance like any other exchange won't let you fetch all your trades at once, but you can do it recursively.
They key is to pass a param named `fromId` to the `fetchMyTrades` method.

The follwing function accepts a `sinceTimestamp` and returns all trades since that timestamp.

Note that I am using [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) library to fetch trades from Binance.

```javascript

const exchange = new ccxt["binanceusdm"]({
    newUpdates: false,
    apiKey: process.env.BINANCE_API_KEY,
    secret: process.env.BINANCE_API_SECRET,
});

async fetchTradesFromExchange(sinceTimestamp) {
  let from_id = undefined;
  let allTrades = []
  const symbol = this.symbol;
  const limit = 100;

  while (true) {
    let params = undefined;
    let since = undefined;

    // if the is no form_id, it means we are fetching
    // the first batch of trades
    if (from_id === undefined) {
      since = sinceTimestamp;
      params = undefined;
    } else {
      // if there is a from_id, it means we are fetching
      // the next batch of trades
      // we need to set the fromId to the last trade's id
      since = undefined;
      params = {
          'fromId': from_id + 1,
      }
    }
    const trades = await exchange.fetchMyTrades(symbol, since, limit, params);
    if (trades.length === 0) {
        break;
    }
    allTrades.push(trades)
    from_id = trades[trades.length - 1]['id']
  }

  return allTrades;
}
```

Hope this is helpful for someone out there! üôè
