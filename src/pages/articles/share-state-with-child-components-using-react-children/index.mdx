Today I came across [React.Children](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/Children) and I thought it was a great way
to share state between child components without using the Context API.

In the following example, we have a parent component that has two child components. The parent component has a state and
it passes the state and a setter function to the child components. The child components can then use the setter function to
update the state of the parent component.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'

const Parent = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState('')

  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

One of the children is a setter component that has a button that when clicked, it sets the state of the parent component. This
components accepts a setter function as a prop and uses it to set the state.

```jsx
const SetterChild = ({ setState }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setState('1')}>Set state</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The second child is just displaying the state of the parent component.This component accepts the state as a prop and uses it to display the state.

```jsx
const DisplayChild = ({ state }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>State: {state}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

And here is how we put together the parent and the children.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Parent>
        <SetterChild />
        <DisplayChild />
      </Parent>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Using React.Children

Now, we can use React.Children to pass the state and the setter function to the children. We can use the `React.Children.map`
function to map over the children and pass the state and the setter function to each child.

```jsx
const Parent = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState('')

  return (
    <div>
      {React.Children.map(children, (child) => {
        return React.cloneElement(child, { state, setState })
      })}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Note that we are using `React.cloneElement` to clone the child and pass the state and the setter function to it. That is
because we can't directly modify the props of a child component. We have to clone it first and then pass the props to it.

With this approach, we don't need to pass the state and the setter function to the children manually. I think it is a great way to
avoid poluting the code with props.

## What if one of the children is not a React component?

What happens if we want to add a `div` or a `p` tag as a child of the parent component? In that case, we are trying to clone and set props
on a element that it's `type` is not a function.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Parent>
        <SetterChild />
        <div>Some text</div>
        <DisplayChild />
      </Parent>
    </div>
  )
}
```

On thing we can do it to check the `type` of the `child` and if it is not a function, we can just return the child as is.

```jsx
const Parent = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState('')

  return (
    <div>
      {React.Children.map(children, (child) => {
        if (typeof child.type !== 'function') {
          return child
        }
        return React.cloneElement(child, { state, setState })
      })}
    </div>
  )
}
```

We can also restrict the use of DOM elements inside the parent component by checking the `child.type` against `string`.

```jsx
const Parent = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState('')

  return (
    <div>
      {React.Children.map(children, (child) => {
        if (typeof child.type === 'string') {
          throw new Error(
            `<${child.type} /> DOM elements are not allowed inside <Parent />`
          )
        }
        return React.cloneElement(child, { state, setState })
      })}
    </div>
  )
}
```
